This is the README for the macrobenchmarks of K2 using sysbench's OLTP read-only 
benchmark. There are two scripts that both execute the same benchmark but with 
different background loads. A single test is run multiple times with different 
I/O schedulers. The output comes in form of a single result directory containing
the benchmark summaries that sysbench produces. The relevant latency parameters
used in the paper can be directly found in these output files (min. latency, 
max latency, average latency, 95th percentile). The number of participating I/O 
schedulers, the device used for testing and the location of the results can be 
configured by changing the corresponding variables at the beginning of both 
shell scripts. Do not worry if the tests take some time, creating a database of
the size used in the benchmarks is a time-consuming process and this is done for
every I/O scheduler.
In order to work correctly, the K2 kernel module must be installed and ready to
be loaded via modprobe. To setup a sufficiently realistic environment, the 
database used for testing as well as the test files for generating background 
load take a rather large amount of space. To avoid any size issues,
the testing device should have a capacity of 200GiB or more. You can decrease
the amount of space needed by lowering the table-size parameters passed to
sysbench as well as by decreasing the size of the background load files 
generated.

WARNING: DO NOT EXECUTE ANY OF THE SCRIPTS ON A SYSTEM WITH A PRODUCTIVE MYSQL
         SYSTEM. DOING SO WILL RESULT IN A DESTRUCTION OF EXISTING DATABASES!!!


File list
---------

Neither of the scripts take any arguments. All of them have to be run as root.

run_sql_ro_ro - Execute the OLTP read-only benchmark of sysbench with a
                read-only background load.
	
run_sql_ro_rw - Execute the OLTP read-only benchmark of sysbench with a         
                mixed read and write background load.
