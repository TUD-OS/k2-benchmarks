This is the README for the macrobenchmarks of K2 using sysbench's OLTP read-only 
benchmark. There are two scripts that both execute the same benchmark but with 
different background loads. A single test is run multiple times with different 
I/O schedulers. The output comes in form of a single result directory containing
the benchmark summaries that sysbench produces. The relevant latency parameters
used in the paper can be directly found in these output files (min. latency, 
max latency, average latency, 95th percentile). The number of participating I/O 
schedulers, the device used for testing and the location of the results can be 
configured by changing the corresponding variables at the beginning of both 
shell scripts. Do not worry if the tests take some time, creating a database of
the size used in the benchmarks is a time-consuming process and this is done for
every I/O scheduler.
In order to work correctly, the K2 kernel module must be installed and ready to
be loaded via modprobe. To setup a sufficiently realistic environment, the 
database used for testing as well as the test files for generating background 
load take a rather large amount of space. To avoid any size issues,
the testing device should have a capacity of 200GiB or more. In order to run
the test successfully, several settings for mysql have to be done, such as
adapting the I/O priority of the daemon, or changing the MySQL data directory.
These steps can be carried out with the script setup_sql. Execute this 
program ONCE before starting the macro benchmarks for the first time.

WARNING: DO NOT EXECUTE ANY OF THE SCRIPTS ON A SYSTEM WITH A PRODUCTIVE MYSQL
         SYSTEM. DOING SO WILL RESULT IN A DESTRUCTION OF EXISTING DATABASES!!!
