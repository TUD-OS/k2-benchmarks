# fio workload file for reproducing the vendor's specifications for random
# writes.
#
# In this case, the fio benchmark file does not come with an enclosing shell
# script. To change the device under test, alter the field "filename". 
# randwrites have been tested with two timing configurations: if the benchmark
# is run for 10s, only the cache of the SSD is used. To achieve sustained 
# throughput values, the runtime parameter has to be set to higher values like
# 60. Note that the values offered are tailored for the Samsung 970evo. Other
# drives may require different settings.
