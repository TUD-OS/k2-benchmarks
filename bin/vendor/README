This directory contains a collection of scripts and benchmark files to 
reproduce performance values given by manufacturers of SSDs. In this case,
throughput and/or IOPS are the relevant metric. The programs are tailored for 
the Samsung 970evo, but should also work for other drives. However, when using 
different hardware, some parameters of the benchmark such as the block size may 
have to be altered in order to obtain the best results. 
Adapting the benchmarks is done by changing the respective lines in the shell 
script and/or the fio file. For fio benchmarks that are enveloped in a shell 
script, the script is the only location where a modified target device has to 
be specified.

Except seqwrite which outputs statistics of dd, all benchmarks will print the
summary of fio to the console. In any case, retrieving the relevant performance 
values is then straightforward. Often, the last few summary lines already 
contain all the information needed. To calculate the IOPS form the overall IOP 
counter, the runtime of the fio tests may be of interest. For all time-based 
benchmarks (read is not!), the default run time is 10 seconds.

File list
---------

read              - Benchmark script for sequential reads. Use "./read" to
                    execute. Takes no arguments.
read.fio          - fio file used by read (not to be executed separately)
randread          - Benchmark script for random reads. Use "./randread" to
                    execute. Takes no arguments.
randread.fio      - fio file used by randread (not to be executed separately)
seqwrite          - Benchmark script for sequential writes. Use "./seqwrite" to        
                    execute. Takes no arguments.
randwrite.fio     - fio file for random writes. Use "fio randwrite.fio" to
                    execute.
randwrite_qd1.fio - fio file for single-threaded random writes using a queue
                    depth of one. Use "fio randwrite_qd1.fio" to execute.
randread_qd1.fio  - fio file for single-threaded random reads using a queue      
                    depth of one. Use "fio randread_qd1.fio" to execute.
