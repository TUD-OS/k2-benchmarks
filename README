     Scripts for Testing the Real-Time Behavior of I/O Schedulers on SSDs
                 Copyright (c) 2018, 2019 Till Miemietz

The scripts contained in this repository can be used to test the behavior of 
different I/O schedulers of the Linux multi-queue block layer in a real-time
scenario. This document only contains general information about the setup and
the requirements to run all tests. The README files in the subdirectories of the
binary folder will give further information on how to use particular scripts.

Make sure that the machine you are running the benchmarks on has at least four
cores. If this is not the case, the fio benchmark files may break. Altering
the CPU number needed involves changing the CPU settings in all .fio files
located in the bin directory. For further information about CPU configuration
for fio benchmarks, please take a look at the documentation of fio.
Also, to get realistic results from the benchmarks, they should not be run
inside a virtual machine. During the original tests, hyperthreading was 
disabled.

Almost all benchmarks will write to the raw device under test. EXECUTING THEM
ON DEVICES OR PARTITIONS WITH MEANINGFUL DATA WILL RESULT IN A TOTAL LOSS OF
THESE FILES!!! Before running the benchmarks, check if the device under test is
actually the one that you want to run the benchmark on. You are able to 
specify the device under test in a central spot at the beginning of all scripts.


Getting Started
---------------

The first step towards executing the benchmarks is installing a fresh 
Ubuntu 18.04 LTS. Choosing the minimal version during installation is 
recommended. Follow the steps in the installer and reboot the system. 
Afterwards, configure your network settings to get access to the internet. Make
sure that your changes get into effect by executing

sudo service network-manager restart

in a terminal. Before you can run the automated setup scripts included in this
repository, you will have to install git and the Korn shell. To to so, use the
following commands:

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install git ksh

Next, clone the k2-benchmark repository:

git clone https://github.com/TUD-OS/k2-benchmarks

Inside the repo, there are two scripts named called pre_reboot and post_reboot.
pre_reboot is responsible for downloading and installing all packages needed to
run the complete toolchain. It also downloads further repositories such as the
modified LTTnG tracer and the K2 I/O scheduler kernel module. When all
prerequisites are present on the system, pre_reboot will build a customized 
version of the 4.15.0 Linux kernel. For that, it uses the kernel build 
configuration as currently used by the OS. However, during kernel building, 
additional messages that ask you for confirmation to build some kernel modules
may pop up. Choosing the default settings for all questions is recommended.
After the kernel is build, the settings of GRUB and MySQL are adapted to the
setup used for the benchmarks.
In short use

./pre_reboot

to do the first step of system setup. When the script is finished, reboot the
system. After system reboot run

./post_reboot

to build and install all components that rely on the modified kernel version.

Now the system should be ready to run all K2-related benchmarks that can be
found in the bin directory.

Script Packages
---------------

There are several categories of benchmark scripts. Detailed information can be
found in the respective directory. Roughly, the subdirectories contain 
scripts to test the following:

micro      - microbenchmarks for testing I/O latencies with different I/O 
             schedulers
mysql      - macrobenchmarks for comparing latencies of I/O schedulers in a
             MySQL setup using sysbench
throughput - scripts for evaluating the tradeoff between queue depth and 
             maximum throughput for the K2 I/O scheduler
vendor     - benchmarks for reproducing the I/O characteristics of drives as
             advertised by their vendors (IOPS/throughput)
postproc   - scripts for generating the plots used in the K2 paper from the 
             raw CSV data files.
